              At the end of our foundation classes at <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/" target="_blank" 
              rel="noopener noreferrer" class="For_ALX">ALXSE</a>
              we had to create my own portfolio project. 
              The Maze-Game project was chosen to learn about game development. 
              We were interested in developing with the programming languages<span id="dots">...</span>
              <span id="more"> we had learned and wanted to learn new methods and 
                techniques that could be implemented in software development. 
                Then we decided to learn about Raycasting tool and 
                implement it using SDL2 library to make this game. 
                It's interesting to know how a game, like Wolfenstein 3D, 
                was able to implement pseudo-3D that revolutionized the gaming industry and 
                opened the way for other game engines and technologies.</span>
